#CPTR212 Final Test

To complete the test, fork this repo and then clone a local copy.  

Leave the "random_array.h" header file unchanged.  It defines an API that you are to both implement and test in the files "random_array.c" and "random_array_test.c", respectively.  

Look at the declarations in the header file, and create your own definitions of them in the "random_array.c" file.  Then test your definitions in the "random_array_test.c" file.  

To submit the assignment, commit your changes and issue a pull request to this repo.  The test ends at 11:50AM, and any commits made after that time will not contribute to your grade.
