# CPTR212 Final Test

To complete the test, fork this repo and then clone a local copy.  

Leave the "random_array.h" header file unchanged.  It defines an API that you are to both implement and test in the files "random_array.c" and "random_array_test.c", respectively.  

Look at the declarations in the header file, and create your own definitions of them in the "random_array.c" file.  Then test your definitions in the "random_array_test.c" file.  

The test ends at 11:45AM, and any commits made after that time will not contribute to your grade.  At that point push the changes to your repo and submit a pull request (do not do so beforehand).
